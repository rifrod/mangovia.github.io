<p>This is a website that I am in the process of creating for my CSC 3750 class. I love mangoes and I just found out I also love creating my own website. So, therefore, I decided to dedicate this website to see how far I can take a mango and be able to relate it to many of the interests that I hold. As I learn more through out the semester, I will be updating the website with new features. Till then feel free to browse around and tell me what you think of my current website.
    If you have any ideas or critisims on how I can improve my website, please feel free to get in touch with me!</p>
